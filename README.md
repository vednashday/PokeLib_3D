‚ú® Features
Interactive 3D Models: View high-quality, animated 3D models of each Pok√©mon with automatic scaling and positioning.

Comprehensive Data: Get detailed information for each Pok√©mon, including types, base stats, and abilities, fetched from the official Pok√©API.

Form Variations: Easily switch between different Pok√©mon forms (e.g., regular, shiny, mega evolutions) and see the 3D model update in real-time.

Seamless Navigation: Browse with ease using "Next" and "Previous" buttons, or return to the main library at any time.

Fully Responsive: The application is designed to be fully responsive, providing a consistent and intuitive experience on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

Engaging Loading State: A custom-built 3D Poke Ball loading spinner makes waiting for data a visually appealing experience.

Robust Error Handling: The application gracefully handles potential issues like missing 3D models by providing smart fallbacks and error boundaries.
